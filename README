==============================================
* Mavuno: A Hadoop-Based Text Mining Toolkit *
==============================================

Mavuno is a Hadoop-based open-source research toolkit that supports a variety of
large-scale distributed text mining operations, including:

* Pattern mining
* NLP Processing (POS Tagging, Chunking, Parsing, Named Entity Recognition)
* Distributional similarity
* Random walks over bi-partite graphs
* Paraphrase harvsting
* Class instance mining
* Semantic relation learning
* Information extraction

=======================
* System Requirements *
=======================

Mavuno requires the following software:
* Java 1.6 (or greater)
* Hadoop 0.20.2

======================
* Configuring Mavuno *
======================

The only configuration necessary is to ensure that the jar files in the
"lib" directory of the Mavuno distributions can be found in the Hadoop
classpath. The simplest way to achieve this is to copy the jars to the "lib"
directory of your Hadoop installation.
